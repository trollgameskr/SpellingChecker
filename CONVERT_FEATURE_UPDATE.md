# Convert Feature Update for Variable Name Suggestion

## Overview
Added the ability to edit the original Korean text in the variable name suggestion result window and regenerate suggestions based on the edited text.

## Changes Made

### 1. MainWindow.xaml.cs
**Added event handler wiring:**
```csharp
popup.ConvertRequested += async (s, text) => await ReprocessVariableNameSuggestion(popup, text);
```

**Added new method:**
```csharp
private async Task ReprocessVariableNameSuggestion(ResultPopupWindow popup, string text)
{
    // Validates text and calls AI service to get new suggestions
    // Updates the popup window with formatted results
}
```

### 2. ResultPopupWindow.xaml
**Added KeyDown event to OriginalTextBox:**
```xml
<TextBox x:Name="OriginalTextBox" 
         ...
         KeyDown="OriginalTextBox_KeyDown"/>
```

### 3. ResultPopupWindow.xaml.cs
**Added KeyDown handler:**
```csharp
private void OriginalTextBox_KeyDown(object sender, System.Windows.Input.KeyEventArgs e)
{
    // Triggers conversion when Enter is pressed (without Shift)
    // Shift+Enter still allows multi-line entry
}
```

## User Experience

### Before
1. User presses Ctrl+Shift+Alt+V to get variable name suggestions
2. Result window shows 3 suggestions
3. User can only copy the results

### After  
1. User presses Ctrl+Shift+Alt+V to get variable name suggestions
2. Result window shows 3 suggestions
3. **User can edit the original Korean text in the "Original" textbox**
4. **User presses Enter or clicks "변환" button**
5. **New suggestions are generated based on the edited text**

## Example Usage

### Initial Request
```
Original: 사용자 이름
Result:
1. userName
2. userFullName
3. accountName
```

### User Edits Original Text
```
Original: 사용자 전체 이름  ← User edited this
Result:   (unchanged, waiting for conversion)
```

### After Pressing Enter or "변환"
```
Original: 사용자 전체 이름
Result:
1. userFullName
2. completeUserName
3. fullUserName
```

## Technical Details

### Enter Key Behavior
- **Enter (alone)**: Triggers conversion
- **Shift+Enter**: Inserts new line (for multi-line Korean text)
- Event is marked as handled to prevent default behavior

### Event Flow
1. User edits text in OriginalTextBox
2. User presses Enter or clicks "변환" button
3. `ConvertRequested` event is raised with edited text
4. `ReprocessVariableNameSuggestion` method is called in MainWindow
5. AI service generates new suggestions
6. `UpdateResult` method updates the result display
7. Progress notifications shown (if enabled)

### Error Handling
- Validates that text is not empty
- Shows notification if text is blank
- Handles API errors gracefully
