# Fix Summary: NullReferenceException in Usage Statistics Window

## Issue
**Issue Reported:** ÌÜµÍ≥ÑÎ≤ÑÌäº ÎàÑÎ•¥Î©¥ ÏóêÎü¨ Î∞úÏÉùÌï©ÎãàÎã§. (Error occurs when clicking statistics button)
**Error Type:** `System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.`
**Location:** `UsageStatisticsWindow.LoadStatistics()` at line 25

## Solution Implemented

### Code Change
**File:** `SpellingChecker/Views/UsageStatisticsWindow.xaml.cs`

**Change:** Added null check in `PeriodComboBox_SelectionChanged` event handler

```csharp
private void PeriodComboBox_SelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    // Prevent execution during initialization before controls are ready
    if (TotalOperationsText == null)
        return;

    // ... rest of method
}
```

### Why This Fixes The Issue

The problem occurred because:
1. WPF's XAML parser sets `IsSelected="True"` on the ComboBoxItem during window initialization
2. This triggers the `SelectionChanged` event **before** all controls are created
3. The event handler tries to access UI controls that don't exist yet
4. Result: NullReferenceException

The null check prevents the event handler from executing during initialization, allowing the window to complete its setup. Once initialized, all subsequent filter changes work normally.

## Impact

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ Statistics window now opens successfully
- ‚úÖ No crash when clicking "üìä View Usage Statistics" button
- ‚úÖ Default "All Time" filter is properly selected

### Not Changed
- ‚úÖ Period filtering functionality (works as before)
- ‚úÖ Statistics display (works as before)
- ‚úÖ Clear history feature (works as before)
- ‚úÖ All other application features (unchanged)

```

## Prevention

### Similar Issues
Searched codebase for similar patterns:
- ‚úÖ Only one `IsSelected="True"` in XAML files
- ‚úÖ No other SelectionChanged handlers with this pattern
- ‚úÖ Other view constructors are safe

### Best Practices
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always check if controls are initialized in event handlers
2. Be aware that XAML events fire during `InitializeComponent()`
3. Consider setting default selections in code-behind after initialization
4. Use null-conditional operators when accessing UI controls in events

## Support

### For Users
If you experience this issue:
1. Update to the latest version
2. The fix is in commit `dbd2502`

### For Developers
If you need to modify this code:
1. Read `FIX_NULLREFERENCE_EXPLANATION.md` first
2. Understand the initialization order
3. Keep the null check in place
4. Test with `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`

## Conclusion

This is a **minimal, surgical fix** that resolves the reported crash without affecting any other functionality. The change is defensive, well-documented, and follows WPF best practices for handling events during window initialization.
