## Resolution

### Answer: YES ‚úÖ

The `copilot/add-usage-statistics-and-history` branch **WAS successfully merged** into the main branch.

### Merge Details
- **Pull Request**: #3
- **Merge Commit**: 2f524ed03a99cadb7bf99a3689867c4132e277a4
- **Merge Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Merged By**: shinepcs
- **Files Changed**: 15 files, +1,426 lines
- **Current Main**: 3d6e54e (includes the merge)

### Evidence

1. **Git History Verification**
   ```
   * 3d6e54e (main) Merge pull request #4 (current main)
   * 2f524ed Merge pull request #3 (usage statistics merge) ‚Üê Feature merged here
   ```

2. **Files Present in Main Branch**
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Services/UsageService.cs
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Views/UsageStatisticsWindow.xaml
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Views/UsageStatisticsWindow.xaml.cs
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml (with button)
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml.cs (with handler)
   - ‚úÖ SpellingChecker/Models/Models.cs (with UsageRecord, UsageStatistics)

3. **Code Verification**
   - ‚úÖ All XAML files are valid XML
   - ‚úÖ All C# files have correct syntax
   - ‚úÖ Integration between AIService and UsageService is complete
   - ‚úÖ Button is properly configured in Settings window (line 106)

4. **Button Location**
   - File: `SpellingChecker/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml`
   - Line: 106-114
   - Grid Row: 6 (between Hotkeys and Save/Cancel buttons)
   - Label: "üìä View Usage Statistics"

## Why the UI Might Not Be Visible

If users report they cannot see the usage statistics button, the issue is **NOT** that the code is missing. The code IS in main. Possible reasons:

### 1. Old Build
The user may be running an application built before October 10, 2025 (before PR #3 was merged).

**Solution**: Rebuild from the latest main branch.

### 2. Need to Scroll
The button is in Grid.Row="6", which is near the bottom of the Settings window.

**Solution**: Scroll down in the Settings window to see the button.

### 3. Build Cache Issue
XAML changes might not be reflected if bin/obj folders contain old compiled files.

**Solution**: Clean build (delete bin/obj folders and rebuild).

### 4. Wrong Branch
The user might be on a branch that doesn't include the merge.

**Solution**: Switch to main branch and pull latest changes.

## How to Access the Feature

1. Build and run the application from main branch
2. Open **Settings** (right-click tray icon or use main window)
3. **Scroll down** past the Hotkeys section
4. Click the blue **"üìä View Usage Statistics"** button
5. The Usage Statistics window will open

## Documentation Created

   - Build verification checklist

3. **USAGE_STATISTICS_ÌÜµÌï©ÌôïÏù∏.md**

   - Quick verification steps
   - Usage instructions

4. **DOCS_INDEX.md** (updated)
   - Added references to new documentation
   - Updated statistics

## Verification Commands

Users can verify the feature is in their code:

```bash
# Check current commit (should be 2f524ed or later)
git log --oneline -1

# Verify button exists in XAML
grep "View Usage Statistics" SpellingChecker/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml

# Verify all files exist
ls -la SpellingChecker/Views/UsageStatisticsWindow.*
ls -la SpellingChecker/Services/UsageService.cs
```

## Conclusion

**The feature IS merged into main.** All code is present and correct. If the UI is not visible when running the application, this indicates a build/deployment issue (old build, cache, or need to scroll), not a source code issue.

## Recommended Actions for Users

1. **Verify code version**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git log --oneline -1  # Should show 3d6e54e or later
   ```

2. **Clean build**:
   ```bash
   dotnet clean
   rm -rf SpellingChecker/bin SpellingChecker/obj
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run and test**:
   - Run the application
   - Open Settings
   - Scroll down to see the button

4. **If still not visible**: See TROUBLESHOOTING_USAGE_STATS_UI.md
