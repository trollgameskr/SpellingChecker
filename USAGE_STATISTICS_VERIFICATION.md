- ✅ AIService calls RecordUsageFromResponse after each API call

### 5. UI Location in Settings Window

The "📊 View Usage Statistics" button is located at:
- **File**: `SpellingChecker/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml`
- **Line**: 106-114
- **Grid Position**: Row 6 (between hotkey settings and action buttons)
- **Visual**: Blue button with emoji icon
- **Label**: "📊 View Usage Statistics"
- **Description**: "Track your API usage, token consumption, and costs"

## How to Access the Feature

1. Open the application
2. Open **Settings** (settings icon in tray or main window)
3. Scroll down past the Hotkeys section
4. Click the **"📊 View Usage Statistics"** button (blue button near the bottom)
5. The Usage Statistics window will open showing:
   - Total operations, tokens, and costs
   - Period filter (All Time, Today, This Week, This Month)
   - Detailed history grid
   - Clear History button

## Possible Reasons for Not Seeing the UI

If a user reports they cannot see the usage statistics button, possible causes:

1. **Old Build**: Running an older build from before PR #3 was merged
   - **Solution**: Rebuild from latest main branch

2. **Window Height**: The button is in a scrollable area
   - **Solution**: Scroll down in the Settings window

3. **Build Error**: XAML not compiled properly
   - **Solution**: Clean and rebuild the solution

4. **Cache Issue**: Old XAML cached
   - **Solution**: Clean solution, delete bin/obj folders, rebuild

## Conclusion

The usage statistics feature **IS fully integrated into main**. All code is present, syntactically correct, and properly connected. The feature was successfully merged in PR #3 and remains in the current main branch (3d6e54e).

If the UI is not visible when running the application, this indicates a build/deployment issue rather than a source code issue.
