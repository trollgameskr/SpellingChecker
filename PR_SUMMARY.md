## 💰 Cost Calculation

The service calculates costs based on OpenAI pricing:

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 |
| gpt-4o | $5.00 | $15.00 |
| gpt-3.5-turbo | $0.50 | $1.50 |

**Formula**: `(prompt_tokens / 1,000,000) × input_price + (completion_tokens / 1,000,000) × output_price`

## 💾 Data Storage

- **Location**: `%APPDATA%\SpellingChecker\usage_history.json`
- **Format**: Plain JSON (no encryption)
- **Privacy**: Local storage only, user has full control
- **Content**: Timestamps, operation types, token counts, costs (no sensitive data)

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User performs correction or translation
2. AIService calls OpenAI API
3. Response includes token usage data
4. UsageService extracts tokens and calculates cost
5. Record saved to usage_history.json
6. User can view statistics from Settings window

## 🎨 UI Design

The Usage Statistics Window includes:

**Summary Panel** (3 columns):
- Operations count (total, corrections, translations)
- Token usage (prompt, completion, total)
- Total cost in USD

**Filters**:
- Period dropdown (All Time, Today, This Week, This Month)
- Clear History button

**History Grid**:
- Date/Time, Type, Model, Tokens, Cost
- Sortable columns
- Alternating row colors
- Most recent records first

## 🧪 Testing

See `TESTING_USAGE_STATS.md` for comprehensive testing guide.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. First-time user (empty statistics)
2. Regular usage (multiple operations)
3. Period filtering
4. Data persistence
5. Clear history
6. Cost calculation accuracy
